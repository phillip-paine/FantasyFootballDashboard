## This script will calculate the team coefficents for the season ahead, including for newly promoted teams. 
# Likely use some reversion to the mean for the start of the season, i.e. previous season estimates and then brought closer to the avg.
# Promoted teams likely using estimate of promoted teams in the past. One thought is to use goals/concede from championship as a feature
# to estimate start of season values.
